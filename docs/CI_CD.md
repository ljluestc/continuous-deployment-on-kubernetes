## Pipeline Architecture

### High-Level Overview

The CI/CD pipeline is built using GitHub Actions and follows a multi-stage approach:

```
Code Commit → Pre-commit Hooks → GitHub Actions → Testing → Security Scan → Build → Deploy → Monitor
```

### Pipeline Stages

1. **Code Quality** - Static analysis, linting, formatting
2. **Testing** - Unit tests, integration tests, benchmarks
3. **Security** - Vulnerability scanning, security analysis
4. **Build** - Application build, Docker image creation
5. **Deploy** - Kubernetes deployment, environment promotion
6. **Monitor** - Health checks, performance monitoring
